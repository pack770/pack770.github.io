title: About Our Pack
---

Pack 770 was established almost 40 years ago by the [Westerville
Civitans](http://westervillecivitan.webs.com/) and has been meeting at [Huber
Ridge
Elementary](http://www.westerville.k12.oh.us/school_home.aspx?schoolID=17)
since it was founded. We are a well established pack with a consistent
membership of over 30 boys.

We think it is important the packs be family oriented and to that end most of
our activities include parents and siblings.  We have found that Cub Scout
packs function best when parents are involved.

Our pack has activities planned year round and we try to focus the program on
outdoor activities, especially in the summer months.  We camp at least three
times a year (sometimes more!) and even make a point to get outside in the
colder months (Winter Hike!)

If your son is not yet a member of the Cub Scouts, here are just a few reasons
to join, in no particular order:

  - It's all about "Fun with a Purpose"
  - Pinewood Derby
  - Summer Day Camp ("Shoot something & get wet every day!")
  - Camping & Hiking
  - Bugs, Worms, Dirt
  - Knots, Pocketknives, Games, Crafts...
  - Weekly Den Activities, Monthly Pack Activities
  - Summertime Activities, too
  - Developing Character [Values](http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/cubscouts/parents/about/characterdevelopment.aspx), Skills, & Friendships that will last a lifetime
  - Learning about & serving our Community
  - Learning about Citizenship
  - Health, Wellness, & Development of Body, Mind, & Spirit
  
If you're new to scouts, we'd like to invite you and your family to join us to
see what it's all about. If you'd like to do so, please [contact us](/contact) and we'll do
our best!
