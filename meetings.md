# Den Meetings

Den meetings are the heart of the Cub Scout program. In the context of the den, scouts learn and grow through
activities with their peers guided by den leaders.

Den meetings normally are held every Monday at
[Huber Ridge Elementary](http://www.westerville.k12.oh.us/school_home.aspx?schoolID=17) and start at 6:30pm. If school
is not in session then the meeting is normally cancelled. Check the [calendar](calendar.html) for details.

On occasion, Den leaders will decided to have a particular meeting at another location if the activity is not
appropriate for a school setting. Examples might include learning fire-building skills, touring the police department,
or earning their whittling chip.

# Pack Meetings

Many packs have regular pack meetings. We do not. Instead we have monthly pack activities that are not on a fixed
schedule. Sometimes these are at Huber Ridge Elementary and sometimes they are not. These activities include things
such as awards ceremonies, holiday celebrations, and camping trips.

# Summer Meetings

There are no den meetings during the summer. Instead, we engage in pack activities of which we try to schedule at
least three per month. Typical activities are camping trips, museum tours, and hiking and biking. Check the calendar
for details.

# Leadership Meetings

The pack committee is in charge of setting the direction of the pack. They meet once a month on Monday after the den
meetings. The meeting starts at 7:30pm. Meetings are typically held on the first Monday after the first Thursday of
every month but are sometimes moved to other Mondays. The dates for pack committee meetings can be found on the
calendar.
