  Pack 770 was established almost 50 years ago by the Westerville Civitans and has been meeting at Huber Ridge
  Elementary since it was founded. We think it is important that packs be family oriented and most of our activities
  include parents and siblings. Experience has shown us that Cub Scout packs function best when parents are involved.
  Our pack engages in activities year round, not just during the school year, and we focus the program on outdoor
  activities to show our children that outside is where the world is.
