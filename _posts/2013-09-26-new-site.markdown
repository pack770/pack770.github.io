We've got a new site on a new platform with a new look. Woohoo!

The plan and purpose of the new site is simple:

- keep everyone up to date on scheduled activities
- provide a place to put links and information that folks in the pack need
- provide some basic information for those who are checking out the pack

The most important link on the site is the [calendar](/calendar) as it provides
the when and where for pack activities. I encourage you to check it if you have
questions about what is going on.

If you have a question, feel free to [contact](/contact) the pack leadership. We
can answer your question or point you to someone who can.

Expect more updates soon!
